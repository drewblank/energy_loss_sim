![Gui](/gui.png)

Energy loss simulation for ions in the Active Target High Efficiency Detector for Nuclear Astrophysics 

This package contains a python script that utilizes pysrim to calculate the energy loss of energetic nuclei through the target gas of ATHENA. 

Inputs include the projectile nulceus charge, mass, and energy as well as the target gas compisition and pressure. The output is a plot of the energy loss deposited in each strip of the detector.
